# BetterTrainBoarding
Unlock the peak efficiency of trains (and also metros):

- Passengers board trains (and metros) sensibly by each preferring the closest compartment
  - To be explained below

# Mod Status
- No known compatibility problems

Because this mod is very small and simple, I am open-sourcing this to everyone out there.

## Types of Transportation Covered
These transportation types are currently covered by this mod:
- Anything under `PassengerTrainAI`:
  - Trains
  - Metros

These transportation types are not yet covered, but are at a low priority:
- Trams
- Buses
- Trolleybuses

They are low priority because, while they can exhibit train-like boarding behavior when multi-trailer vehicles are used, the small total length of those vehicles means that the train-like boarding behavior is not obvious, and can be ignored.
