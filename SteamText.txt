中文名：火車上車易

[h1]Quick info[/h1]
[list]
[*]Requires Harmony
[*]Load after IPT2; more details in FAQ
[*]Passengers board trains and metros by preferring the closest available trailer
[*]Greatly improves efficiency of trains/metros
[*](New) Now also supports trams (light rails)
[*]Should also work with monorails
[*]火車乘客/地鐵乘客上車時會優先選擇最接近自己嘅車卡
[*]大幅改善火車/地鐵效率
[*](新) 電車 (輕鐵) 亦有得益
[*]應該對單軌列車同時有效
[/list]

In my game, the metro lines were always a problem. While they e.g. certainly can carry more passengers than buses, for some reason they just feel less effective that they seem.

It turns out this is caused by the game's simple algorithm for loading passengers into the metro. This causes problems when the metro cannot accept all passengers waiting at the platform:
[list]
[*]Passengers are to be sent into the metro sequentially from the front to the end of the platform, until the metro is full
[*]They can spend too much time walking to the correct trailer, e.g., when front-most passengers are are assigned the back-most metro trailer
[/list]
This causes metros to be delayed, which creates a vicuious cycle: there will be more passengers waiting at the next station.

And so, this mod makes changes such that:
[list]
[*]Passengers will board the metro by each of their own closest trailer, until the metro is full
[*]Most of the time, this means the passengers will board the trailer in front of them, saving boarding time
[/list]

[h1]What you can do with this mod[/h1]
With this mod enabled, you can do the following:
[list]
[*]Have city-centre metro lines that actually work
[*]Have long-distance inner-city train lines that actually work
[*]Generally increases the efficiency of inner-city transportation

And that's all!

我知道地鐵嘅優勢係例如可以有好高嘅載客量，但我總係覺得遊戲入面嘅地鐵嘅效能比想像中差好多。

後來發覺原來係因為本game處理乘客上車嘅時候用咗一個簡單嘅步驟，但係呢個步驟會喺滿座「上唔晒」嘅情況下出現問題：
[list]
[*]乘客上車時，先由車頭到車尾，前往任何車卡上車，直至滿座
[*]有機會令乘客由車頭行去車尾上車，浪費大量時間
[/list]
惡性循環出現了：地鐵上車出現延誤，導致下一站有更多人等車，更容易滿載。

因此，本mod作出以下修改：
[list]
[*]乘客上車時，會先各自選擇最接近自己嘅車卡上車，直至滿座
[*]通常情況下，乘客會登上面前嘅車卡，節省上車時間
[/list]

[h1]有何好處?[/h1]
你可以順利模擬部分香港交通形勢：
[list]
[*]市區地鐵：高載客量、減少延誤
[*]市郊鐵路：大站上落客不再係一個黑洞
[*]改善市內交通效率
