In my game, the metro lines were always a problem. While they e.g. certainly can carry more passengers than buses, for some reason they just feel less effective that they seem.

A similar situation also plagues the bus lines. I certainly made sure there are enough vehicles to move the passengers, but for some reason, CIMs just give up too soon when waiting for buses.

It turns out this is caused by the game's simple algorithm for loading passengers into the metro. This causes problems when the metro cannot accept all passengers waiting at the platform:
[list]
[*]Passengers are to be sent into the metro sequentially from the front to the end of the platform, until the metro is full
[*]They can spend too much time walking to the correct trailer, e.g., when front-most passengers are assigned the back-most metro trailer
[/list]
This causes metros to be delayed, which creates a vicuious cycle: there will be more passengers waiting at the next station.

The same algorithm also causes problems where the bus (and other types of transport) cannot accept passengers in a logical manner:
[list]
[*]The loading algorithm does not take into account who arrived first
[*]Very often in intermediate stops, some passengers are consistently left behind due to insufficient capacity in each individual passing bus 
[/list]
This generates a consistent group of "leftover" passengers, who either give up or spawn their pocket vehicles, creating sudden unexplained congestions just like that.

And so, this mod makes changes such that:
[list]
[*]Passengers will board the metro by each of their own closest trailer, until the metro is full
[*]Most of the time, this means the passengers will board the trailer in front of them, saving boarding time
[*]I have also made it such that passengers board metros, buses, etc in a first-come-first-served basis
[*]Most of the time, this means the wait-timer of passengers will stay consistently low where possible, and car traffic should decrease
[/list]

[h1]What you can do with this mod[/h1]
With this mod enabled, you can do the following:
[list]
[*]Have city-centre metro lines that actually work
[*]Have long-distance inner-city train lines that actually work
[*]Have frequent-service bus lines (long or short) that actually work
[*]Generally increases the efficiency of inner-city transportation
[/list]
Interestingly, one good side effect of this mod is that external connection passenger transport (e.g. planes, ships, etc) now almost always spawn with full passenger load,
so this mod has applications beyond simply improving passenger train boarding.

And that's all!

我知道地鐵嘅優勢係例如可以有好高嘅載客量，但我總係覺得遊戲入面嘅地鐵嘅效能比想像中差好多。

同時間，巴士亦有類似問題。即使我已經派夠車，應該夠載，但巴士乘客亦經常等得太耐提早放棄等車。

後來發覺原來係因為本game處理乘客上車嘅時候用咗一個簡單嘅步驟，但係呢個步驟會喺滿座「上唔晒」嘅情況下出現問題：
[list]
[*]乘客上車時，先由車頭到車尾，前往任何車卡上車，直至滿座
[*]有機會令乘客由車頭行去車尾上車，浪費大量時間
[/list]
惡性循環出現了：地鐵上車出現延誤，導致下一站有更多人等車，更容易滿載。

而同樣嘅步驟亦都令巴士(以及其他公共交通)唔能夠正常上客：
[list]
[*]上車步驟並冇留意乘客等車嘅先後次序
[*]呢個經常導致中途站出現以下情況：當巴士唔夠載時，將會有一批乘客總係上唔到車
[/list]
問題出現：呢班「被忽略」嘅乘客，一係就直接放棄，一係就轉用私家車，加劇塞車。

因此，本mod作出以下修改：
[list]
[*]乘客上車時，會先各自選擇最接近自己嘅車卡上車，直至滿座
[*]通常情況下，乘客會登上面前嘅車卡，節省上車時間
[*]我亦都指示，地鐵、巴士等等乘客上車時，以「先到先上」次序上車
[*]通常情況下，等車時間將會降低，亦都減少私家車使用量
[/list]

[h1]有何好處?[/h1]
你可以順利模擬部分香港交通形勢：
[list]
[*]市區地鐵：高載客量、減少延誤
[*]市郊鐵路：大站上落客不再係一個黑洞
[*]車海巴士(或其他公共交通)：人進得去，車出得來，車海發大財
[*]改善市內交通效率
[/list]

有趣地，使用本mod可同時享用一個良好副作用：地圖聯外交通車輛(例如飛機、郵輪等)會先盡量上滿乘客，然後再出現。
